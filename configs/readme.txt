This directory contains copies of my Astrometrica configuration files. They need to be tailored for your own use.

In the Observing Site tab insert your own name in a similar format.
In the environment tab set up the directories as you want them locally.

The files are set up to use GAIA DR2 catalog. You can change that on the Program tab, but if you do so you will also need to change
the CCD tab/Color Band to Visual.
