This directory contains copies of my Astrometrica configuration files. 

TO USE THESE FILES YOU NEED TO BE ON THE LATEST ADES COPY OF ASTROMETRICA Version 4.12.0.448
To get this version download http://www.astrometrica.at/Beta/Astrometrica.zip. Then replace your existing copy of Astrometrica.exe
with the one in the zip file.

Tailor the config files for your own usage:
In the Observing Site tab insert your own name in a similar format.
In the environment tab set up the directories as you want them locally.

The files are set up to use the GAIA DR2 catalog. You can change that on the Program tab, but if you do so, you will also need to change
the CCD tab/Color Band to Visual.
